<p><strong>The Indian Meal</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Indian meal is a complex and little-understood phenomenon. “Typical” meals often include a main starch such as rice, sorghum, or wheat; vegetable or meat curries that are dry roasted or shallow wok fried; cured and dried vegetable dishes in sauces; and thick lentil soups, with different ingredients. Condiments might include&nbsp;<em>masalas&nbsp;</em>(a dry or wet powder of fine ground spices and herbs) plain yogurt, or a vegetable&nbsp;<em>raita</em>&nbsp;(yogurt dip, also called&nbsp;<em>pachchadi</em>&nbsp;in south India), salted pickles, fresh herbal and cooked chutneys, dried and fried wafers and salted&nbsp;<em>papadums</em>&nbsp;(fried lentil crisps), and occasionally dessert (called “sweetmeats”). Indian meals can have huge variations across the subcontinent, and any of these components in different orders and with different ingredients might constitute an Indian meal.</p>

<h2><strong>Rice is a powerful symbol of both hunger and want as well as fulfillment and fertility. Until the late nineteenth century, however, only the wealthy&nbsp;</strong><strong>ate</strong>&nbsp;<strong>rice,</strong>&nbsp;<strong>and</strong>&nbsp;<strong>most</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Indians</strong>&nbsp;<strong>consumed</strong>&nbsp;<strong>millet</strong>&nbsp;<strong>and</strong>&nbsp;<strong>sorghum.</strong></h2>

<p>When a multi-dish meal is served on a large platter in north India, the serving utensil is usually made of silver for purity. A banana leaf might be the main platter for a south Indian festival. In either case, there are various small bowls for each dish. This kind of meal is called a&nbsp;<em>thali</em>&nbsp;and is named for the platter on which it is served. The meal is eaten first with a sweet, followed by all the dishes served simultaneously and mixed together with the rice, based on the eater’s discretion. The meal ends with yogurt, which is thought to cool the body, and then followed by sweets and/or fruit. Festival meals usually end with a digestive in the form of a&nbsp;<em>paan</em>&nbsp;(betel leaf and nut folded together), which again has regional variations of style and taste.</p>

<p>Rice is a powerful symbol of both hunger and want as well as fulfillment and fertility. Until the late nineteenth century, however, only the wealthy ate rice, and most Indians consumed millet and sorghum. Nevertheless, the powerful symbolism of rice as a sign of fertility for many castes makes it part of marriage rites. Welcoming a new bride to the family home includes having her kick over a measure of rice to indicate that she brings prosperity to the household. A traditional test of a worthy daughter-in-law is her ability to “wash” the rice properly and to gauge the right amount of water it draws while cooking. Rice is still a symbol of wealth, and those families who have access to “wetland” where rice paddies grow are still thought to be wealthy and well endowed. Long grain scented basmati rice is India’s most popular variety and is valued in foreign markets as well. Efforts of the Indian government to protect Indian basmati rice failed, and now two types of American basmati exist, a situation many Indians consider shameful.</p>

<p><strong>Gastronomic Calendars, Rituals, and Seasonality</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In India as elsewhere, food culture is shaped by climate, land, and access to natural resources. The food system emphasizes eating agricultural and natural produce “in season,” such as mangoes and local greens during the summer, pumpkins during the rainy monsoon months, and root vegetables during the winter months. This emphasis is based upon a belief that in-season foods are more potent, tastier, and of greater nutritional value, although the yearround availability of many foods due to technology are beginning to change eating habits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cooks who are native to India are aware of culinary cycles and of multiple-dish recipes using fruits and vegetables of the season, some deemed “favorites” within caste groups and families. For example, prior to the ripened mango harvest of May and June, tiny unripe mangoes are harvested and pick- led in brine. The ripe mango and the pickled mango are the same species but are clearly different culinary tropes with different characteristics that are some- times attributed with fortifying, healing, auspicious, and celebratory values, based on taste, color, and combination. Connoisseurs are aware of desirable foods in local areas and sometimes travel great distances to acquire the first or best product of the season. Seasonality and regionality are also part of wed- ding celebrations, funerary rites, and domestic feasts. The winter peasant menu of the Punjab&nbsp;<em>sarson</em>&nbsp;<em>ka saag</em>, a stew of spicy mustard greens believed to “heat” the body, and&nbsp;<em>makki</em>&nbsp;<em>ki</em>&nbsp;<em>roti</em>&nbsp;<em>(</em>griddled corn flatbreads), are imported to haute tables in Delhi restaurants as “rustic” fare.</p>

<p>Religious festivals also align with culinary cycles, festivals, or sacred periods of the year that are often associated with offerings to the gods and feasting on certain foods. The south Indian Harvest festival of Pongal in February is accompanied by a feast of harvested rice cooked with lentils in three different dishes,&nbsp;<em>shakkarai</em>&nbsp;<em>pongal</em>&nbsp;(Tamil-sweet),&nbsp;<em>ven pongal&nbsp;</em>(Tamil-savory), and&nbsp;<em>akkara</em>&nbsp;<em>vadashal</em>&nbsp;(Tamil-milk), accompanied by a stew of nine different winter vegetables and beans, offered first to tutelary deities and then consumed as consecrated food. Temples, especially those dedicated to the Hindu God Vishnu, have a long history of developed culinary traditions and food- offering aesthetics. The Krishna Temple in the south Indian temple town of Udupi is known throughout India for the distribution of free seasonal meals to thousands of devotees. Other temples are known for offerings of certain sweets or savories of that region or enormous and detailed menus of offerings from the land.</p>

<p><strong>The Globalization of Indian Food</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although it has never had a standardized diet, India has traditionally “imagined” its cuisine with respect to the incorporation and domestication of “foreign” influences. In the past two decades, with India becoming an economic powerhouse, a variety of multinational fast food companies have entered the previously protected Indian culinary landscape. They include Pizza Hut, Mc- Donald’s, KFC, Pepsico, and, most recently, Taco Bell. These companies have had to “Indianize” and self-domesticate to conquer the notoriously difficult-to-please Indian palate.2 Today, urban fast food chains in India have become common and are transforming the middle class diet.</p>

<p>At the same time, local food purveyors have taken complex regional recipes and modified them for ease of industrial production, leading to a pack- aged food boom in India.3 The Indian food market of $182 billion is believed to be growing at a rapid clip of 13 percent.4 Indian precooked packaged foods empires such as MTR, SWAD, Haldirams, and Pataks have gone global, avail- able wherever Indians now live, leading a quiet yet unrecognized revolution in eating habits. Formerly, the focus was upon rural, natural, fresh, and prepared on-site food. Now, there is a shift in emphasis to industrialized, processed food. These developments are partially reengineering local and caste-based special- ties for mass production, distribution, and consumption, changing past notions of what is traditional or valued.</p>

<p>Another aspect of globalization is the phenomenon of branding an Indian cuisine, largely the product of curry houses in the United Kingdom. Curry itself is not a dish but a category, comprising both dry and gravy vegetable dishes spiced variously with specific&nbsp;<em>masalas</em>&nbsp;(spice and herb mixtures) and is said to derive its name from the usage of the south Indian “curry leaf,” a citrus leaf used as a flavoring agent. Indian food, as it is billed outside India, is the reimagined second-tier fare of north Indian eateries, a blend of Punjabi and Mughlai cuisine modified to suit the local taste. In the US, Indian restaurant menus mostly tend to be the same, and the diversity of the nation’s cuisine is greatly underrepresented. As Lizzie Collingham’s evocative history of curry has shown, the spread of Indian eateries in the United Kingdom has been viewed by some commentators as a political response by the Indian diaspora to centuries of colonization and the incorporation of British food in India. Whatever the larger motivations and readings, it is clear that the spread of South Asian restaurants and curry houses in the UK has brought with it welcome changes in the British diet.</p>

<p>Some scholars have suggested that Indian food is filtered through Great Britain to the world, though diasporic Indian groups have also contributed. North American eateries serve curries and rice,&nbsp;<em>tandoori</em>&nbsp;<em>chicken</em>,&nbsp;<em>naan</em>, and&nbsp;<em>chicken</em>&nbsp;<em>tikka</em>&nbsp;<em>masala</em>&nbsp;(said to be invented in Glasgow), while the Japanese make&nbsp;<em>karai&nbsp;</em>and rice, demonstrating the attractiveness of “exotic” India’s cultural power and reach.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The cultures of contemporary Indian cuisine, including the politics, food processes, production, and consumption, are simultaneously changing and exhilarating. Further innovation and increased attention to Indian cuisine will almost certainly occur and promises to be an exciting area of innovation and critical research in the future.</p>
